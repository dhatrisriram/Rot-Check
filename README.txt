This is a readme text file usually to give instructions, so follow this to run the program

Initially after you extract the zip file u should have first installed flask, tensorflow and pillow.

To install the above libraries run cmd prompt as admin and run the following command: "pip install Flask tensorflow pillow" (without the quotation marks)

after installing, change close cmd prompt and open it again as admin and change directory to the project folder (where the templates, carrot_dataset folders all are there) and run "python carrot_classifier.py" 

after running wait for it to run some loading lines till u don't see any more processes (usually two sets of loading lines) and search for a http link in the codes generated by command prompt, copy paste it but make sure to not hit ctrl+C twice as the second time it will exit the program (basically hit once) and then paste the http link in any web browser and make sure to have a good internet connection

upload a pic of the carrot u want to check and hit classify and get results.
