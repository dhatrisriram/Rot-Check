The Carrot Classifier is a machine learning-based web application that classifies images of carrots, determining whether they are suitable for packaging or not. This project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to process the images and make predictions. Users can upload carrot images via a simple web interface, and the application will return a classification based on the pre-trained model.

The goal of this project is to automate the quality assurance process for carrot packaging, reducing human error and improving efficiency.

Features:

Image Upload: Users can upload images of carrots.
Real-time Classification: The machine learning model processes the image and returns a classification.
Web Interface: Built using Flask, providing an easy-to-use interface.
Model Accuracy: Trained on a dataset of carrot images to ensure accuracy in predictions.
User Feedback: Users can submit feedback on the classification result, helping to improve future iterations of the model.
